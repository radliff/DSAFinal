RUNNING THE CODE:
1. IMPORTANT: MUST run python backEnd/backEnd.py first to start server. This is how the website fetches the spotify requests.
2. Cd to react-app, enter npm run build in your terminal.
3. Enter npm start, this should route you to the website

USING THE WEBSITE:
1. Login with your spotify credentials
2. Enter the link from your playlist (This link MUST come from the spotify web app, otherwise you will get an error message saying the link is not real)
3. Click the category that you want to compare your playlist to, and wait for the results to load.
